1stel Introduces StratoSTACK

for Apache Cloudstack Platform

Cleburne, TX -  Local business telecommunications company, 1stel, announced the release of StratoSTACK on April 1, 2016. StratoSTACK is a billing portal designed for use with the Open Source Apache CloudStack (ACS) platform.

The StratoSTACK Billing portal enables developers, system integrators, managed service providers, and others providing services over the ACS platform to offer Instance creation, provisioning, and billing without purchasing a cost prohibitive billing module.  The StratoSTACK Billing portal uses ACS standard application programming interfaces (API) for seamless transmission of data between the Instance and underlying cloud infrastructure.  

“I'm so excited to be part of the StratoStack software release. Now all the pieces are in place for a fully open source cloud solution that includes billing and provisioning," says Randall Smith, 1stel project manager.
